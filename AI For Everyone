AI has tools such as ML, DS, deep learning
1.Machine Learning
Concept: A to B, running AI system, a field that gives the computer the ability to learn (often result in a software)
Framework: collect data, train model (iterate until good enough), deploy model (get data back, maintain/update model)
2. Data Science
Concept: get insight to help making business decisions, (often output a slide deck)
Framework: collect data, analyze data (iterate unitil good), suggest hypothesis/actions (deploy changes, re-analyze new data periodically)
3. Deep learning: commonly used

Choose an AI project: what AI can do (AI experts) intersects with values in your domain (domain experts)
brainstorm framework:
1. think about aumating tasks and choose from the tasks
2. what are the main drivers of business value
3. What are the main pain of the business
4. you can make progress without big data

Check if the project is worthwhile: due diligence on project
technical diligence (doable): can AI meet desired performance, how much data is needed, engineering timeline
business diligence: reduce cost, increase revenue, create new product
